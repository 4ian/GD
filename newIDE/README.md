# GDevelop IDE

This is a new, revamped editor for GDevelop. It is based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com), [Pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js) and [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/).
It uses GDevelop [core C++ classes compiled to Javascript](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop.js) to work with GDevelop games.

## Installation

Make sure to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is optional.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4ian/GD.git
cd GD/newIDE/app
yarn #or npm install
```

## Development

```bash
yarn start #or npm start
```

This will open the app in your web browser.

Images resources, GDJS Runtime, extensions will be copied in resources, and [libGD.js](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop.js) will be downloaded automatically.

### Development of the standalone app

You can run the app with Electron. **Make sure that you've run `yarn start` in `app` folder before** (see above).

```bash
cd newIDE/electron-app
yarn #or npm install

#For macOS:
./node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron app

#For Windows:
node node_modules\electron\cli.js app

#For Linux:
./node_modules/electron/dist/electron app
```

### Development of UI components

You can run a [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) that is used as a playground for rapid UI component development and testing:

```bash
cd newIDE/app
yarn storybook #or npm run storybook
```

## Building and deploying the standalone app

### Desktop version

```bash
cd newIDE/electron-app
yarn build #or npm run build
```

This will build and package the Electron app for Windows, macOS and Linux (according to your OS).
The output are stored inside `newIDE/electron-app/dist` and copied to `Binaries/Output/Release_XXX`.
Version number is read from `newIDE/electron-app/app/package.json`.

### Webapp version

```bash
cd newIDE/web-app
yarn deploy #or npm run deploy
```

## Current status

This new editor is still in development and is missing some features:

- [ ] Autocompletion of expressions and parameters in Events editor.
- [ ] Creating and editing groups of objects
- [ ] Support for native games
- [ ] Export with Cocos2d-JS to Android and iOS.

## Additional help

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Check out their documentation for common tasks or help about using it.
