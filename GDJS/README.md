_HTML5/Javascript_ based games with GDevelop.

> ðŸ“š **Game developer, searching for the documentation?** Go to the **[GDJS Runtime (game engine) documentation](http://4ian.github.io/GD-Documentation/GDJS%20Documentation)**.

## Development

GDJS is composed of two parts:

- the JavaScript game engine (_Runtime_ folder), called _GDJS Runtime_.
- the C++ part exposing GDJS to GDevelop IDE (_GDJS_ folder), including the Exporter and classes doing transpilation from events to JavaScript, called _GDJS Platform_.

### GDJS Runtime (game engine)

The game engine is in the _Runtime_ folder. If you want to work on the engine directly, follow the [GDevelop 5 README about development of the game engine](https://github.com/4ian/GD/blob/master/newIDE/README.md#development-of-the-game-engine).

To use the game engine, you can look into the **[GDJS Runtime (game engine) documentation](http://4ian.github.io/GD-Documentation/GDJS%20Runtime%20Documentation)**.

### GDJS Platform (exporters, code generation...)

Check the [GDJS Platform](http://4ian.github.io/GD-Documentation/GDJS%20Documentation/index.html) documentation, or the [full GDevelop developers documentation](http://4ian.github.io/GD-Documentation/).
