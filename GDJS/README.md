GDevelop Javascript Platform (HTML5 game engine)
================================

GDevelop Javascript Platform (GDJS) is the game engine for making
*HTML5/Javascript* based games with GDevelop.

Getting started
---------------

GDJS is composed of two parts: the C++ part exposing the GDJS to GDevelop IDE (*GDJS* folder), including the Exporter and classes doing transpilation from events to JavaScript, and the Javascript game engine (*Runtime* folder).

  * First, take a look at the *Readme.md* at the root of the repository. For GDevelop 5, [follow the README](https://github.com/4ian/GD/blob/master/newIDE/README.md) to start the editor.
  * If you then want to work on the game engine, take a look at the *Runtime* folder and at [the scripts](https://github.com/4ian/GD/tree/master/GDJS/scripts) that will be useful to have your changes reflected in GDevelop.
  * For reference, you can look into the [developer documentation](http://4ian.github.io/GD-Documentation/) and the documentation of GDJS [here](http://4ian.github.io/GD-Documentation/GDJS Documentation).
